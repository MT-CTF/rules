### By playing on this server you agree to these rules:
1. No swearing, dating, or other inappropriate behaviour.
2. No spamming, using all-caps, or any other method of chat abuse.
3. Don't be a cheater. No hacked clients.
4. Spawnkilling is considered excessive and thus forbidden if it doesn't contribute to the goal of the game in a proper way. Consequently, spawnkilling can already be punished if only two kills are made, depending on the situation.
5. Don't be a traitor, don't dig blocks in your base to make it less secure or to trap team mates, and don't help the other team win.
6. Don't leave the game whilst in a fight
7. Don't impersonate other community members
8. Do not share your password with ANYONE.
9. Avoid controversial topics like politics/religion
10. Moderator decisions are final.

Failure to follow these rules may result in a kick or ban (temp or permanent) depending on severity.
